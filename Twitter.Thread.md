#FuelLKApp

1/ Did you find @ICTA_SriLanka's https://fuel.gov.lk/ a bit hard to navigate?

I know some of you did and so did I.
So, I wrote a "wrapper app" centred on the #SriLanka Map to improve #UEX a bit.

Read on for details.

2/ Fuel Sheds around #SriLanka are colour-coded as follows:

ðŸŸ¢ Got fuel...   
ðŸŸ  Had some fuel...
ðŸ”´ Updated status...
...in the last 24 hours

3/ Click "Nearby" to zoom to wherever you are.

"Refresh" zooms out to show the entire island.

4/ Click on the Shed circles for more details about the Shed, including availability of different types of fuel, fuel dispatches, capacity, address etc.

5/ The app pulls data from https://fuel.gov.lk's API.

@GitHub repo https://github.com/nuuuwan/fuel_lk
hosts both the data and the code for fetching the data.

6/ @GitHub repo https://github.com/nuuuwan/fuel_lk_app hosts the front-end code.

Please fork/contribute.

And I agree - wrappers are not ideal. So, it would be  awesome if the original writers of https://fuel.gov.lk use some of this code in the original site.

7/ As always, I'd appreciate comments, concerns and suggestions. And please report any bugs!
